     I'd really like to either have all those properties and methods available 
     at module level, or at least direct access to an BASS object instead of 
     always have to instanciate the class myself, similar to how twisted 
     handles its reactor access. That'd be much more comfortable, since nothing 
     within this class requires saving any object-specific niformation and the 
     properties are global anyway, which might confuse one or another because 
     of the way classes and objects usually contain local data only.

      The plugin requires a different BASS version. Due to the use of the 
      "stdcall" calling-convention, and so risk of stack faults from 
      unexpected API differences, an add-on won't load at all on Windows if 
      the BASS version is unsupported, and a

    There are two ways in which add-ons can provide support for additional 
    formats. They can provide dedicated functions to create streams of the 
    specific format(s) they support and/or they can plug into the standard 
    stream creation functions: 
    :meth:`Bass4Py.bass.OutputDevice.create_stream_from_file`, 
    :meth:`Bass4Py.bass.OutputDevice.create_stream_from_bytes`, 
    :meth:`Bass4Py.bass.OutputDevice.create_stream_from_url`, and 
    :meth:`Bass4Py.bass.OutputDevice.create_stream_from_file_obj`. This function 
    enables the latter method. Both methods can be used side by side. The 
    obvious advantage of the plugin system is convenience, while the dedicated 
    functions can provide extra options that are not possible via the shared 
    function interfaces. See an add-on's documentation for more specific 
    details on it. 

    As well as the stream creation functions, plugins also add their 
    additional format support to sample creation functions:
    :meth:`Bass4Py.bass.OutputDevice.create_sample_from_bytes` and 
    :meth:`Bass4Py.bass.OutputDevice.create_sample_from_file`.
    
    Information on what file formats a plugin supports is available via the 
    :attr:`Bass4Py.bass.Plugin.formats` property.

    When using multiple plugins, the stream/sample creation functions will 
    try each of them in the order that they were loaded via this function, 
    until one that accepts the file is found. 

    When an add-on is already loaded (eg. if you are using functions from it), 
    the plugin system will use the same instance (the reference count will 
    just be incremented); there will not be 2 copies of the add-on in memory.

    is 5000 milliseconds. If the length specified is outside this range, it 
    is automatically capped. 

    The default buffer length is 500 milliseconds. Increasing the length, 
    decreases the chance of the sound possibly breaking-up on slower computers, 
    but also increases the latency for DSP/FX. The buffer length should always 
    be greater than the update period (:attr:`Bass4Py.bass.BASS.update_period`), 
    which determines how often the buffer is refilled. Small buffer lengths 
    are only required if the sound is going to be changing in real-time, for 
    example, in a soft-synth. If you need to use a small buffer, then the 
    :attr:`Bass4Py.bass.OutputDevice.buffer` attribute should be used to get 
    the recommended minimum buffer length supported by the device and its 
    drivers, and add that to the update period plus some margin for the 
    stream's processing. Even then, it is still possible that the sound could 
    break up on some systems, it is also possible that smaller buffers may be

      the feature is not supported on this platform


    The device buffer is where the final mix of all playing channels is 
    placed, ready for the device to play. Its length affects the latency of 
    things like starting and stopping playback of a channel, so you will 
    probably want to avoid setting it unnecessarily high, but setting it too 
    short could result in breaks in the sound. When using a large device 
    buffer, the :attr:`Bass4Py.bass.Channel.buffer` attribute could be used to 
    skip the channel buffering step, to avoid further increasing latency for 
    real-time generated sound and/or DSP/FX changes. The buffer length needs 
    to be a multiple of, and at least double, the device's update period, 
    which can be set via the :attr:`Bass4Py.bass.BASS.device_update_period` 
    option. The buffer length will be rounded up automatically if necessary 
    to achieve that. The system may also choose to use a different buffer 
    length if the requested one is too short or long, or needs rounding for 
    granularity. Changes to this config setting only affect subsequently 
    initialized devices, not any that are already initialized. The "No Sound" 
    device does not have a buffer, so is unaffected by this option. 

    Platform-specific

    The default setting is 30ms on Windows, 40ms on Linux and 200ms 
    on Windows CE. This option is not available on OSX; the device 
    buffer length on this platform is twice the device update period, 
    which can be set via the :attr:`Bass4Py.bass.BASS.device_update_period` 
    option. On Windows, this config option only applies when WASAPI output is 
    used. On Linux, BASS will attempt to set the device buffer-feeding thread 
    to real-time priority (as on other platforms) to reduce the chances of it 
    getting starved of CPU, but if that is not possible (eg. the user account 
    lacks permission) then it may be necessary to increase the buffer length 
    to avoid breaks in the output when the CPU is busy.

    :obj:`bool`: Do not stop the output device when nothing is playing on it? 

    By default, BASS will stop sending data to the output device when nothing 
    is playing, to save a little CPU/power. When that happens, the device buffer 
    will become empty, and the next playback will begin more quickly as a 
    result. Or it may be delayed if the device has gone to sleep in the 
    meantime. If more consistent playback latency (around the value given by 
    :attr:`Bass4Py.bass.OutputDevice.latency`) is wanted, this option can be 
    enabled to keep the device buffer filled with silence when nothing is 
    playing. The output will still be stopped by 
    :meth:`Bass4Py.bass.OutputDevice.stop` then.
